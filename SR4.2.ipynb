    "Binary search perfoms faster than linear serach for large dataset Binary search performs faster than linear search for large datasets. Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the dataset. This means that the algorithm checks each element one by one, resulting in a linear increase in time taken as the dataset grows. Binary search, on the other hand, has a time complexity of O(log n). This means that the algorithm divides the dataset in half with each comparison, resulting in a logarithmic reduction in time taken as the dataset grows. Here's a rough estimate of the number of comparisons required for each algorithm: Linear search: n comparisons (where n is the number of elements) Binary search: log2(n) comparisons (where n is the number of elements) For example, if you have a dataset of 1 million elements: Linear search would require approximately 1,000,000 comparisons Binary search would require approximately 20 comparisons (log2(1,000,000) = 20) As you can see, binary search is much faster than linear search for large datasets. However, for small datasets, the difference in performance may be negligible.\n",
